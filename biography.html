                    The story of Tupac Amaru Shakur, one of the most influential
                    and enduring figures in the world of music and culture,
                    begins with a childhood marked by both adversity and
                    promise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>Birth and Family:</span> Tupac was born on June 16,
                    1971, in East Harlem, New York City. His mother, Afeni
                    Shakur, was an activist and a member of the Black Panther
                    Party, which strongly influenced Tupac’s early beliefs and
                    values. His father, Billy Garland, was largely absent from
                    his life during his formative years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>Early Struggles:</span> Growing up in poverty, Tupac
                    faced the challenges of an unstable home environment. His
                    family moved frequently, and he often changed schools.
                    Despite these hardships, he showed early promise and
                    creativity. Tupac’s love for the arts, particularly acting
                    and poetry, began to emerge during his childhood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>Baltimore Years:</span> In 1986, Tupac’s family
                    relocated to Baltimore, Maryland. It was during this time
                    that he attended the Baltimore School for the Arts, where he
                    honed his acting and rapping skills. His time at this school
                    had a profound impact on his artistic development and his
                    outlook on life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>Early Activism:</span> Tupac’s mother, Afeni, played a
                    pivotal role in shaping his consciousness. She instilled in
                    him a sense of pride in his African heritage and a
                    commitment to social justice. These early lessons would
                    later become central themes in his music and activism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>Artistic Beginnings:</span> Tupac’s journey into the
                    world of hip-hop began as he joined a local rap group called
                    “Strictly Dope.” It was clear from the start that he
                    possessed a remarkable talent for lyrical expression. His
                    early experiences in the music industry set the stage for
                    his future as a groundbreaking artist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>The Road Ahead:</span> Tupac’s early life was marked
                    by tumultuous events, but it also laid the foundation for
                    his remarkable career. As he ventured into the world of
                    music, film, and activism, he would draw upon these early
                    experiences to become a voice for the marginalized and an
                    artist whose impact endures to this day.

                  <p>
                    <span>The Night of September 7, 1996:</span>
                    Tupac was in Las Vegas, Nevada, to celebrate his business
                    partner Tracy Danielle Robinson's birthday. He attended the
                    highly anticipated boxing match between Bruce Seldon and
                    Mike Tyson at the MGM Grand alongside Marion "Suge" Knight,
                    the CEO of Death Row Records.

                  <p>
                    <span>The Altercation:</span>
                    After the boxing match, a chance encounter in the MGM Grand
                    lobby changed the course of the evening. One of Suge
                    Knight's associates spotted Orlando "Baby Lane" Anderson, a
                    member of the Southside Compton Crips, who was allegedly
                    involved in a previous attempt to rob them. Surveillance
                    footage shows an altercation between Tupac's group and
                    Anderson.

                    Following the altercation, Tupac and Suge Knight left the
                    hotel and headed to their Death Row nightclub, Club 662, in
                    a black BMW 750iL sedan. At approximately 11:15 pm, while
                    stopped at a red light on Las Vegas Boulevard, a white
                    Cadillac sedan pulled up to the passenger side and an
                    occupant opened fire. Tupac was struck multiple times,
                    sustaining gunshot wounds to his arm, thigh, and chest.
                    Shards from the bullets hit Suge Knight. Tupac's bodyguard,
                    Frank Alexander, was not in the car at the time.
